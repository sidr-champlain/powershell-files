# powershell-files

The above PowerShell Commands / Scripts can be used for many purposes. I have listed how to create a new user, admin or standard. I also listed useful
network commands and computer information to help identify a specific computer.

You can edit these in any text editor (just make sure to save with ps1 extension) or Windows PowerShell ISE.
